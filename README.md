# Middletown-Website-Redesign
I created this website in my Advanced Web Design course as a senior. I started by designing wireframes for this website using Adobe XD, editing photos for the website with Adobe Photoshop, and creating graphics with Adobe Illustrator. Then, I coded this website in Sublime Text using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal was to improve the current Middletown website's functionality and design. This was my first time coding a website for both mobile and desktop using media queries.
